# Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using any image editor. For a basic colored square icon:

1. Create a square image with the desired dimensions
2. Fill it with a color (e.g., #1a73e8 for Gmail blue)
3. Optionally add text or a simple design
4. Save as PNG format

## Quick Icon Generator

You can use online tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Or any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)

For a minimal working extension, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders.
